Paneer Makhani is a delicious variety of Indian Paneer cooked in buttery tomato cashew gravy. It tastes little spicy and has its own eccentric sweetness. After the making of the dish, fresh cream is poured over the paneer with which the dish glows. It is an easy recipe which takes about roughly 20- 25 minutes to prepare.
